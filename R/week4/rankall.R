# rankall takes two arguments: an outcome name (outcome) and a hospital 
# ranking (num). The function reads the outcome-of-care-measures.csv file and 
# returns a 2-column data frame containing the hospital in each state that has 
# the ranking specified in num.
# The function should return a value for every state (some may be NA). 
# The first column in the data frame is named hospital, which contains
# the hospital name, and the second column is named state, 
# which contains the 2-character abbreviation for the state name. 
# Hospitals that do not have data on a particular outcome should be excluded 
# from the set of hospitals when deciding the rankings.
#
# Acoording to the data book, "Death Mortality Rates" are in columns 11, 17 and 23
