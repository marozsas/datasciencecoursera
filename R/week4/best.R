# The function best take two arguments: the 2-character abbreviated name of a 
# state and an outcome name. The function reads the outcome-of-care-measures.csv
# file and returns a character vector with the name of the hospital that has the
# best (i.e. lowest) 30-day mortality for the specified outcome in that state. 
# The hospital name is the name provided in the Hospital.Name variable. 
# The outcomes can be one of “heart attack”, “heart failure”, or “pneumonia”. 
# Hospitals that do not have data on a particular outcome should be excluded 
# from the set of hospitals when deciding the rankings.
# Handling ties. If there is a tie for the best hospital for a given outcome, 
# then the hospital names should be sorted in alphabetical order and the first 
# hospital in that set should be chosen (i.e. if hospitals “b”, “c”, and “f” 
# are tied for best, then hospital “b” should be returned).
#
# Acoording to the data book, "Death Mortality Rates" are in columns 11, 17 and 23
#

# MAR, november/2016
